**BISHOP'S MESSAGE**<br />
Brothers and Sisters,<br />
<br />
Quoting from 1 Kings 3:<br />
*“In Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. And Solomon said…give thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad…”*<br />
<br />
With Solomon’s petition to the Lord for the gift of discernment, we may ask ourselves how we might also develop spiritual gifts, including the gift of discernment (see “Quick to Observe,” Elder David A Bednar).<br />
<br />
President Nelson recently taught of the importance for each of us to seek the spiritual gift of testimony:<br />
*“Do you want to know Jesus Christ better? …Do you want to experience the sweet, soothing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ working in your life? Seeking to answer these questions will require effort—much effort. I plead with you to take charge of your testimony. Work for it. Own it. Care for it. Nurture it so that it will grow. Feed it truth…Engage in daily, earnest, humble prayer. Nourish yourself in the words of ancient and modern prophets. Ask the Lord to teach you how to hear Him better. Spend more time in the temple and in family history work. As you make your testimony your highest priority, watch for miracles to happen in your life.”*<br />
<br />
Let us each seek the “best gifts” (1 Coe 12:31), that we might also walk in the Lord’s “ways” (1 Kings 3:14).<br />
<br />
