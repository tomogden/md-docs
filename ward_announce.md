**BISHOP'S MESSAGE**<br />
Brothers and Sisters,<br />
<br />
Speaking to the National Press Club downtown this week, Elder David Bednar commented:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*“Sadly, the news of our day is filled with heartache-including the tragic events and the loss of life most recently in Texas. We mourn with those who mourn and pray for all those impacted by this senseless act of violence. My prayer and my blessing is that we will be guided, comforted, and helped in our important work, and that victims, families, and nations might be granted the peace that surpasses all understanding - the peace that comes from Jesus Christ.”* <br />
<br />
The prophet Joshua invited his people to “cleave unto the Lord your God, as ye have done unto this day” (Joshua 23:8; Jacob 6:5). In our day, prophets also point us to Christ, and urge us to take time for the Lord each day. <br />
<br />
In April 2021, President Nelson encouraged us:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*“For a time, the pandemic has canceled activities that would normally fill our lives. Soon we may be able to choose to fill that time again with the noise and commotion of the world. Or we can use our time to hear the voice of the Lord whispering His guidance, comfort, and peace. Quiet time is sacred time—time that will facilitate personal revelation and instill peace.”* <br />
<br />
As we make time for Christ, we can know Him as the “founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people” (Mosiah 15:18). <br />
<br />
