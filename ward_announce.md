**BISHOP'S MESSAGE**<br />
Brothers and Sisters,<br />
<br />
When the Israelite King, Saul, was disobedient to the Lord’s instructions, the Prophet Samuel knew that he needed the Lord’s guidance as he prepared to meet Saul. Seeking revelation, Samuel *“cried unto the Lord all night…and rose…early in the morning”* (1 Sam 15:11-12). Samuel’s inspired counsel the next day, including important teachings on obedience and humility, followed personal prayer, seeking the Lord’s will with real intent.<br />
<br />
Speaking of our personal opportunity to commune with God, President Nelson recently taught:<br />
<br />
*“God knows all and sees all. In all of eternity, no one will ever know you or care about you more than He does. No one will ever be closer to you than He is. You can pour out your heart to Him and trust Him to send the Holy Ghost and angels to care for you. He demonstrated His ultimate love when He sent His Only Begotten Son to die for you — to be your Savior and your Redeemer!”*<br />
<br />
God hears every sincere prayer. As we seek to hear Him, we can be blessed as we consider our own pleadings with the Lord in prayer. Rather than praying to remove another’s agency, for example, we may pray to be empowered by the Lord to change what we can change. As we learn to *“counsel with the Lord”* (Alma 37:37), prayer will truly build and strengthen our relationship with our loving Father in Heaven (D&C 19:38, 3 Nephi 18:20). May we all receive this blessing.<br />
<br />
