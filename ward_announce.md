**BISHOP'S MESSAGE**<br />
Brothers and Sisters,<br />
<br />
As we read of young Samuel's experience of learning to hear and obey the Lord's voice, three questions from the Come Follow Me manual are instructive.<br />
- What do you learn from Samuel about hearing and obeying the Lord’s voice? <br />
- What experiences have you had with hearing His voice? <br />
- What opportunities do you have, like Eli, to help others recognize when the Lord is speaking to them?<br />
Learning to hear the voice of the Lord, and then to obey that voice as did Samuel (""Speak Lord, for thy servant heareth."" 1 Sam 3:11) is of paramount importance. President Nelson recently spoke of the blessings of seeking and hearing the voice of the Lord:<br />
<br />
*“When the Savior atoned for all mankind, He opened a way that those who follow Him can have access to His healing, strengthening, and redeeming power. These spiritual privileges are available to all who seek to hear Him and follow Him. My dear brothers and sisters, with all the pleadings of my heart, I urge you to get on the covenant path and stay there. Experience the joy of repenting daily. Learn about God and how He works. Seek and expect miracles. Strive to end conflict in your life.”*<br />
<br />
Regularly hearing the voice of the Lord through the living prophet is a particular miracle of the ongoing restoration. May we all seek and receive this blessing.<br />
<br />
