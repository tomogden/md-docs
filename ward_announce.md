**BISHOP'S MESSAGE**<br />
Brothers and Sisters,<br />
<br />
As the Lord reduced Gideon’s military force from 32,000 to 300, He made it clear to Gideon that He would be their deliverer:<br />
<br />
*“And the Lord said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.”* (Judges 7:2)<br />
<br />
And by His miraculous deliverance, as with Noah, Joseph, Moses, and Joshua before, the Lord delivered Gideon’s outnumbered forces from their enemy. Our living prophet, President Nelson, recently issued a promise regarding the Lord as a “God of Miracles”:<br />
<br />
*“Moroni assured us that “God has not ceased to be a God of miracles.” Every book of scripture demonstrates how willing the Lord is to intervene in the lives of those who believe in Him. He parted the Red Sea for Moses, helped Nephi retrieve the brass plates, and restored His Church through the Prophet Joseph Smith. Each of these miracles took time and may not have been exactly what those individuals originally requested from the Lord. In the same way, the Lord will bless you with miracles if you believe in Him, “doubting nothing.” Do the spiritual work to seek miracles. Prayerfully ask God to help you exercise that kind of faith. I promise that you can experience for yourself that Jesus Christ “giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.” Few things will accelerate your spiritual momentum more than realizing the Lord is helping you to move a mountain in your life.”*<br />
<br />
Many of us have recently experienced miracles around the DC Temple open house, as friends and neighbors have felt the Savior’s love and learned more about His restored church by visiting the open house. As we reflect on these experiences and pray for missionary opportunities daily, the Lord will inspire us to help these individuals take additional steps closer to the Savior.  We can trust in the Lord — that He can do His work — and join Him to seek miracles in the lives of loved ones. <br />
<br />
