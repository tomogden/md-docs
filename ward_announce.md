**Bishop's Message ============**<br />
Brothers and Sisters,<br />
<br />
From this week's Come Follow Me manual:<br />
<br />
Even on foot, it wouldn’t normally take 40 years to travel from the wilderness of Sinai to the promised land in Canaan. But that’s how long the children of Israel needed, not to cover the geographical distance but to cover the spiritual distance: the distance between who they were and who the Lord needed them to become as His covenant people.<br />
<br />
A significant event that took place during the Israelites' wandering is described in Numbers 21:<br />
_“And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.  Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord, and against thee; pray unto the Lord, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.”_<br />
<br />
This episode is mentioned elsewhere in scripture (John 3:14-15, 1 Nephi 17:41, Alma 33:18-22, Alma 37, Helaman 8:14-15) and was clearly a significant spiritual experience for those who were willing to look to the symbol that Moses prepared. This symbol is spoken of in the Book of Mormon as a type of Christ (Alma 33:18). As we also look to Christ - His gospel, His attributes, and repentance through His atonement - we also have hope and newness of life in Him.  <br />
