**BISHOP'S MESSAGE**<br />
Brothers and Sisters,<br />
<br />
When Naaman, a captain in the Syrian army, sought a miracle from Elisha, he was initially “wroth” with the instruction to “wash in the Jordan seven times” to be healed from leprosy. An Israelite servant nevertheless persuaded Naaman to heed Elisha:<br />
*“…if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when [Elisha] saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? Then went [Naaman] down, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. (2 Kings 5:13-14)”*<br />
<br />
Like Naaman, we may also initially look for reasons to follow prophetic invitations. Naaman first reasoned that Elisha the prophet should have come meet him directly instead of sending a servant to speak with him. Next, if a dip in water was going to be the solution, surely the rivers of Syria were “better than all the waters of Israel” and might be more suitable for this process. Fortunately, Naaman repented and was miraculously cleansed.<br />
<br />
Elder Neil Anderson has taught:<br />
*Anchoring our souls to the Lord Jesus Christ requires listening to those He sends…We live in a world of reason, debate, argument, logic, and explanation. Questioning, “Why?” is positive in so many aspects of our lives, allowing the power of our intellect to guide a multitude of choices and decisions we face each day. But the Lord’s voice often comes without explanation…Beyond relying on the intellect alone, we treasure the gift of the Holy Ghost.*<br />
<br />
As we each seek to follow the prophet as well as the promptings of the Holy Ghost, I know that we will be blessed as we focus more on the “what” and less on the “why” of divine invitations.<br />
