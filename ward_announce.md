**Bishop's Message ============**<br />
Brothers and Sisters, <br />
<br />
Throughout the Book of Deuteronomy, the Lord counsels the Israelites to always remember their deliverance from Egypt:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*“…remember that thou wast a servant in the Land of Egypt, and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched arm…”* (5:15)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*“Thou shalt not be afraid…but shall well remember what the Lord thy God did unto Pharoah, and unto all Egypt…”* (7:18)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*“And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee…”* (15:15)<br />
<br />
There are many different ways to remember the Lord and acknowledge His deliverance in our lives. In the Spanish translation of the scriptures, the word remember is often translated as a word associated with something being recorded – “recordar” is that word. But in some instances (e.g., D&C 4:6, 2 Nephi 9:39, Alma 5:52) the English word for remember is translated to Spanish as having something present in our minds: “tened presente.”<br />
<br />
As we partake of the sacrament, we covenant each week to “always remember” Jesus Christ (D&C 20:77,79; Moroni 4, 5). What if we take this at face value, to always remember Him, to have Him present – in our daily prayers, but also in our daily work and in our interactions with others? Remembering Him is a key to unlocking the power of Jesus Christ in our lives: “…let virtue garnish thy thoughts unceasingly; then shall thy confidence wax strong in the presence of God…and the Holy Ghost shall be thy constant companion…” (D&C 121:45-46).  <br />
<br />
And as we remember Him, He remembers us: “Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands” (1 Nephi 21:16). May we ever remember Him and realize the blessing of the sacrament each week.<br />
<br />
