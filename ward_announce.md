**Bishop's Message**<br />
Brothers and Sisters,<br />
<br />
With the Israelites at the base of Mount Sinai, the prophet Moses ""sought diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of God"" (D&C 84:23). The Israelites were invited to be sanctified, to ""wash their clothes,"" to ""be ready,"" and to come to ""the mount"" (Exodus 19:10, 11, 17).  We are receiving similar invitations from God's prophet on the earth today, President Nelson, that we might be prepared for the Lord Jesus Christ through repentance, covenants, and ""life in Christ"" (Romans 8:2):<br />
<br />
Repentance is required of every accountable person who desires eternal glory. There are no exceptions. In a revelation to the Prophet Joseph Smith, the Lord chastised early Church leaders for not teaching the gospel to their children. Repenting is the key to progress. Pure faith keeps us moving forward on the covenant path. Please do not fear or delay repenting...Walking the covenant path, coupled with daily repentance, fuels positive spiritual momentum.<br />
<br />
Two questions from this week's Come Follow Me lesson may be helpful for us to consider:  <br />
What do you do to prepare for sacred experiences in your life, such as attending the temple or partaking of the sacrament?<br />
What can you do to more fully prepare for these experiences?<br />
I know that the Lord will spiritually nourish our hearts as we prepare for sacred experiences.<br />
